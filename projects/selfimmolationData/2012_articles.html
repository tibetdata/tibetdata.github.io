1. EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE OF TIBET on 2012-03-29:

2. IN SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE OF TIBET on 2012-05-18: 
 [&quot;Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the people of Tibet and to thank groups like Students for a Free Tibet for all the work they do to raise awareness on this issue. For too long, the Tibetan people have suffered numerous human rights violations at the hands of the People&apos;s Republic of China. In the fight for Tibetan freedom, 35 Tibetans have set fire to themselves since February 2009 to protest China&apos;s occupation of their land. At least 23 of them have died. Their sacrifice should not go unnoticed. They have given their lives to show the world the suffering the Tibetan people endure at the hands of Chinese government.&quot;, &apos;Additionally, there are numerous Tibetans who have been arrested for speaking out against the government and advocating for the freedom of Tibet. These political prisoners need to be set free. Their only crime is standing up for the rights of the Tibetan people. While China continues to enforce policies that encroach on the freedoms of Tibetans, the people continue to conduct peaceful demonstrations. It is our responsibility to support the Tibetan people both politically and financially.&apos;, &apos;As a body, we should carry on our support for the Tibetan people by continuing to fund areas such as development, refugee programs, and Radio Free Asia and Voice of America. By supporting programs such as these, we encourage Tibetan livelihood and culture. U.S. assistance has supported sustainable development, environmental conservation, and cultural preservation in Tibet since 2000. Let us continue this support to contribute to a better future for Tibet.&apos;, &quot;We should also continue to support the Dalai Lama&apos;s efforts to negotiate a peaceful solution for Tibet with the Chinese government. The Tibetan people are a peaceful people and we should support their belief system in finding a peaceful solution to this problem. Let us lend our support to the people of Tibet so that they can continue their fight for freedom.&quot;, &apos;I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the people of Tibet.&apos;]

3. SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS on 2012-01-30: 
 [&apos;Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Lieberman, Rubio, Boxer, Durbin, McCain, Webb, and Mark Udall to submit a resolution expressing our deep concern about the current situation in Tibet and our steadfast support for the Tibetan people.&apos;, &apos;Once again, we have seen how harsh and counterproductive Chinese policies have heightened tensions and led to deadly violence.&apos;, &apos;According to press reports and the International Campaign for Tibet, since the beginning of the Chinese New Year on Monday, security forces in Sichuan province have opened fire three times on Tibetans who gathered peacefully to protest Chinese policies on Tibet.&apos;, &apos;At least six Tibetans have been killed and many more wounded.&apos;, &apos;These attacks come on top of a recent spate of self-immolations mostly by Tibetan monks and nuns.&apos;, &apos;Since March 2011, at least 16 Tibetans, including four this month alone, have set themselves on fire and at least 12 have died.&apos;, &apos;I know I join my colleagues in mourning these tragic deaths and the death of Tibetans in this latest round of unrest.&apos;, &apos;In addition, I call on Chinese security forces to exercise maximum restraint and stop targeting Tibetan protesters.&apos;, &apos;Violence is not the answer to the legitimate grievances of the Tibetan people.&apos;, &apos;We must raise our voice with this resolution to call on Beijing to respect the right of Tibetans to practice their own religion freely and preserve their distinct cultural and linguistic identity.&apos;, &quot;This resolution mourns the death of Tibetans who have self-immolated and deplores the repressive policies targeting Tibetans; calls on the Government of the People&apos;s Republic of China to suspend implementation of religious control regulations, reassess religious and security policies implemented since 2008 in Tibet, and resume a dialogue with Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including the Dalai Lama or his representatives, to resolve underlying grievances; calls on the Government of the People&apos;s Republic of China to release all persons that have been arbitrarily detained; to cease the intimidation, harassment and detention of peaceful protestors; and to allow unrestricted access to journalists, foreign diplomats, and international organizations to Tibet.&quot;, &apos;The resolution commends His Holiness the Dalai Lama for his decision to devolve his political power in favor of a democratic system; congratulates Tibetans living in exile for holding, on March 20, 2011, a competitive, multi-candidate election that was free, fair, and met international electoral standards; and reaffirms the unwavering friendship between the people of the United States and the people of Tibet.&apos;, &apos;Over the past several years I have been following the situation in Tibet with increasing concern.&apos;, &apos;I became involved in this issue when I first met His Holiness the Dalai Lama during a trip to India and Nepal in the fall of 1978.&apos;, &apos;At that time, as Mayor, I invited His Holiness to visit San Francisco and he accepted.&apos;, &apos;In September 1979, I was delighted to welcome the Dalai Lama to San Francisco to receive his first public recognition in the United States.&apos;, &apos;He inspired me to act and I have had the privilege to call him a friend for over 30 years.&apos;, &apos;Over this time, I have come to the view that Chinese policies on Tibet are intended to suppress the Tibetan culture and people.&apos;, &apos;These policies include punitive security measures including permanently placing Chinese officials in monasteries; surveillance, mass arrests, and detentions; and restrictions on freedom to practice religion including requiring monks to denounce the Dalai Lama.&apos;, &apos;We have seen how these policies have created an atmosphere of despair, hopelessness, and frustration among many Tibetans.&apos;, &apos;Despite nine rounds of talks between the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China and envoys of His Holiness, a comprehensive solution to the Tibetan issue remains out of reach.&apos;, &apos;As a friend of China and the Dalia Lama, I am saddened to see the situation in Tibet deteriorate to this point.&apos;, &apos;The Dalai Lama has been trying to engage the Chinese leadership for over fifty years.&apos;, &apos;In the 1990s, I carried three letters to President Jiang Zemin from the Dalai Lama requesting a face to face meeting.&apos;, &quot;In my view, the Dalai Lama&apos;s concerns are driven by a strong Tibetan belief and experience that the Chinese Government continues to suppress the Tibetan culture and way of life.&quot;, &quot;As my colleagues know, the Dalai Lama has made it clear that he does not support independence for Tibet, but rather meaningful cultural and religious autonomy for the Tibetan people within the People&apos;s Republic of China.&quot;, &apos;Most recently, in his March 2011 statement marking the 52nd anniversary of the peaceful Tibetan uprising he stated:&apos;, &quot;In our efforts to solve the issue of Tibet, we have consistently pursued the mutually beneficial Middle-Way Approach, which seeks genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people within the [People&apos;s Republic of China].&quot;, &apos;The newly elected prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile, Dr. Lobsang Sangay, has affirmed this policy in his inaugural address:&apos;, &quot;Guided by the wisdom of our forefathers and foremothers, we will continue the Middle-Way policy, which seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet within the People&apos;s Republic of China.&quot;, &apos;Despite these repeated and unequivocal statements, Beijing continues to insist that His Holiness seeks independence for Tibet.&apos;, &apos;I am stunned that this message has fallen on deaf ears.&apos;, &apos;Let there be no doubt: the clear goal of His Holiness and the Tibetan people is autonomy within China.&apos;, &apos;This autonomy can only come about through meaningful dialogue and negotiation, not actions that would undermine Tibetan culture.&apos;, &apos;As such, I urge the administration to work with our friends and allies in the international community and call on the Chinese Government to begin a substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama on national reconciliation, respect for the Tibetan culture, and meaningful autonomy for Tibet.&apos;, &apos;I urge my colleagues to stand up for the Tibetan people and support this resolution.&apos;]

8. TIBET on 2012-04-24: 
 [&quot;Mr. President, I want to draw the Senate&apos;s attention to the ongoing, intensifying and intolerable oppression occurring in Tibet.&quot;, &apos;Over the past year, at least 32 Tibetans, most of them young men and women, have set themselves on fire to protest Chinese policies that are infringing on Tibetan self-governance, cultural traditions and religious beliefs and practices. Of them, it is believed that at least 23 have died. Eleven have self-immolated in the past 2 months alone. These incidents do not represent a temporary deviation from a peaceful norm but are instead the latest response to a tragic, and unfortunately lengthy, history of religious and cultural controls, human rights violations and oppression of the Tibetan people.&apos;, &apos;Reports from Tibet indicate that the Chinese government is further restricting access to foreign journalists and tightening security throughout the region. Chinese police and other officials in Tibet are forcing some nuns and monks to publicly denounce the Dalai Lama. Schools in some provinces have been forced by the government to switch their official language of instruction from Tibetan to Mandarin Chinese. These policies, among others, have incited Tibetans to protest and fight for the survival of their cultural identity and basic freedoms.&apos;, &quot;In recent weeks, a state-run Chinese website and news agency accused the Dalai Lama of encouraging Tibetans to set themselves on fire and of advocating &#96;&#96;Nazi&apos;&apos; racial policies. Mr. President, many of us in the Senate have had the privilege of meeting the Dalai Lama and I am proud to consider him a friend. It is baseless, offensive, and deplorable to slander the Dalai Lama in this way or to suggest that he is inciting violence. He is a man whose entire life has been devoted to peace.&quot;, &quot;For decades, the Dalai Lama has sought to work with the Chinese government to reach a peaceful resolution over Tibet&apos;s political status. The Dalai Lama has, time and time again, extended a hand of friendship to Beijing, which has consistently responded by drastically misrepresenting his views and accusing him of inciting violence, perhaps to draw attention away from their own brutal actions. The Chinese government must know that violent crackdowns and cultural genocide will never be condoned.&quot;, &quot;We share many interests with China and the future can bring our two countries closer. China&apos;s tremendous economic transformation in the past few decades has brought great benefits to the Chinese people and has spurred economic development in other countries. That said, the economic emergence of China and its increased presence on the world stage must be accompanied by respect for human rights. China cannot be a global leader while crushing peaceful dissent in its own backyard, destroying the culture of the Tibetan people, and imprisoning Tibetan leaders.&quot;, &quot;I want to mention one of these imprisoned leaders, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche. Tenzin Delek was recognized by the Dalai Lama as a reincarnate lama in the 1980s. He was detained in April 2002 on charges of exploding bombs and spreading politically charged leaflets and, following a closed trial, sentenced to death on December 2, 2002. After appeal, Tenzin Delek&apos;s sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. No evidence of his involvement in any illegal activity has ever been made public. In fact, before being detained, Tenzin Delek was well-known for educating children in rural areas and helping to build monasteries. Tenzin Delek&apos;s imprisonment is just one of the many examples of persecution of Tibetan leaders that appear to be motivated by a desire to curb Tibetan religious and cultural expression.&quot;, &quot;Many Tibetan protestors, both imprisoned and free, are not seeking independence from China. Tibetan leaders, including the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Prime Minister, Lobsang Sangay, who I was pleased to meet earlier this year, have explicitly stated that they support the Middle-Way&apos; policy, which seeks autonomy for Tibet within the People&apos;s Republic of China. Tibetans are not fighting for separation from China; they are fighting for the freedom of religious belief guaranteed to them by the Chinese Constitution. They are fighting for the security of their monks and monasteries. They are fighting for freedom of expression, association, and assembly, for personal liberty, for unrestricted media access, and for the fundamental principles of democracy that we in the United States take for granted.&quot;, &quot;We cannot and will not abandon the Tibetan people, who have long been our unwavering friends. We will stand by them to protect the principles of democracy in the face of China&apos;s repressive policies. Together, the Tibetans and the Chinese can peacefully reach a solution that meets the needs and aspirations of both peoples. It is imperative that we support peaceful dialogue and discourage violent confrontation whenever it occurs, whether supported by the Chinese authorities or Tibetan protestors.&quot;, &quot;I am a cosponsor of Senator Feinstein&apos;s resolution, S. Res. 356, A Resolution Expressing Support for the People of Tibet, and I urge other Senators to do so. We can foster closer, cooperative relations with China, but until China works with Tibetan leaders to pursue a new way forward, their reputation in the community of nations, and their ability to act as a global power, will remain tarnished. I hope that, in the years to come, the young Tibetans who sacrificed their lives in the past year will be remembered as the catalysts for a political dialogue that cemented a peaceful future for both Tibet and China.&quot;]

12. CORVALLIS WILL NOT BE BULLIED BY CHINA on 2012-09-12: 
 [&apos;Recently, the Chinese consul general sent a letter to the mayor of Corvallis, a small city in my district. The letter was followed up by personal visits by the vice consul and the deputy consul general. Now, we always welcome visitors, but under these circumstances, we have some concerns.&apos;, &quot;They are trying to pressure the mayor of the City of Corvallis to compel a local businessman to remove a mural dedicated to free Tibet and Taiwan independence from his downtown building. It was characterized by the local newspaper as a shakedown because the original letter broadly hinted that it might be in Corvallis&apos; best interest economically to cooperate with the request.&quot;, &apos;I am shocked and appalled that apparently Chinese professional diplomats have failed to read the Constitution of the United States of America before traveling here to represent their country.&apos;, &apos;This represents the basis of our representative democracy, our freedom of speech, and our rights, and it will not be bullied by China or any other overseas interest.&apos;]

13. SYRIA on 2012-03-15: 
 [&apos;Madam President, first, I want to thank my colleagues for coming to the floor today and talking about the issue of energy and energy independence and the rising cost of energy. It is critically important. I wish to talk about something else, if I could, for just a few minutes, something I think is of critical importance, eternal importance; that is, the issue of human rights.&apos;, &apos;As Americans, we have to remind ourselves our Nation was founded on the principles of human rights. If we read back to the earliest documents, the Declaration of Independence first says very clearly at the outset that one of the founding principles that led to the creation of this Nation, and the Republic and Constitution that followed that, was the notion that all of us are created equal. Every human being on the planet who was ever born, ever will be born anywhere in this world, was born with certain rights, and the source of those rights is our Creator.&apos;, &apos;Think about that for a moment. That is not a common belief. For almost all of our history people believed our rights as people came not from our Creator, they came from the government, from our leaders. Our rights are what the government allows us to have. That is not what founded our country. This country was founded on the very powerful idea that the source of our rights and our value as a human being came from our Creator.&apos;, &apos;Of course, that manifested itself in all sorts of things in this country, a constitution, for example, that in recognition of those rights created a system of government that said the job of the government was to protect these rights, not to grant them. And, of course, the American miracle has plenty of witnesses, myself included, and is well documented in the annals of history, particularly in the last half century, the American century, the 20th century, which is shown as an example to the world. Yet the issue of human rights continues to be a central one around the world and one of the places where I think an American example can make the biggest difference. &apos;, &quot;One of the issues that has interested me since I got to the Senate--my background before I got here just a year ago was in State government, and before that it was in local government. One of the great things about being in the Senate is you have access to sources of information and individuals with information that I didn&apos;t have before. One of the issues that has fascinated me on a global scale is how human rights are still summarily violated all over the planet and how, in fact, these powerful ideas that are at the core of our founding as a country are still not widely accepted in many parts of the world.&quot;, &quot;This is a great time of year to be in Washington. People are on spring break, and they are bringing their kids up here to learn about our Republic. So I think it is a great time to remind ourselves that one of the things that made us different from the rest of the world is that we are one of the few countries on the planet that really believe that every single person who has ever been born has rights they are born with. We take that for granted. If you have been born here and lived here your whole life, you think that is the way it is everywhere. It is not. There are so many societies and countries around the world where people are told: You don&apos;t have any rights unless we give you rights. Unless your government or your leaders or your laws give you certain rights, you don&apos;t have these rights. In America, we almost take that for granted because we believe we are born with these rights. And the American example to the world has been what can happen when you actually believe that every single human being has worth and value and rights that they are born with and that you have no right to deny them.&quot;, &apos;Sadly, there is no shortage of examples around the world where those fundamental rights are violated. I think no nation on this planet has a larger obligation to speak out against it than ours. So what I intend to do over the next few weeks is come to the floor and highlight some of these egregious human rights violations because I think they go to the core of our exceptionalism. They go to the heart of who we are as a people and as a nation. They go to the center of what makes us different from other countries around the world and in many respects are at the heart of what is in debate at this very moment in the world.&apos;, &quot;As we enter this new 21st century, there are a handful of nations across the globe that do not want the issue of human rights to be central. They don&apos;t want this issue to be on the front burner because they don&apos;t believe in these things. What they seek is a new international order where the violation of human rights is nobody&apos;s business.&quot;, &quot;You see that today in Syria, where people are being murdered, where unarmed civilians are being pursued and shelled by an army, where there are horrifying examples of human rights violations on a daily basis. At least two countries--Russia and China--have taken the position that it is nobody&apos;s business, and one of those countries is the topic I want to talk about today; that is, China--an emerging power on the world stage that some people I think falsely claim will replace America on the world stage. I think that is an exaggeration.&quot;, &quot;By the way, we welcome the economic progress China has made. I think it is great news that there are millions of people in China who a decade ago were riding around on a bike and now have a car. Only a decade ago millions of people were living in deep poverty and today are part of the middle class. I think that is fantastic. But don&apos;t get ahead of yourself in believing that China is going to replace America on the world stage. This is still the richest, most powerful country in the world. This is still the most important economy on the planet, and our people are as smart and as creative as they have ever been, and that is not going to change.&quot;, &apos;But I think we have to look at China because if, in fact, they are this rising power, if they are going to be a growing influence on the international stage, we have to ask ourselves, What is their commitment to human rights? Sadly, it is not a very good one.&apos;, &apos;If you look at the issue of Tibet, it is a perfect example. These are peace-loving people who have sought a certain level of autonomy. They want to preserve their culture and their way of life. They have gone as far as to say: We are OK being under Chinese rule, but we want to protect some of the things that are innate and indigenous to our own culture and values. And China is systematically trying to erase their culture and their heritage through processes of re-education, through the jailing of people, through the oppression of people, through the destruction of a free press and systems of communication. It manifests itself today. I think yesterday was the latest incident of people in Tibet setting themselves on fire. By the way, we should not encourage that. It is horrifying to see that. We hope it stops. It just leads to an understanding of the level of desperation that exists in Tibet.&apos;, &apos;Let me ask you a question. If China is a growing influence on this planet, are these the values that are going to replace American values on the world stage? Are these the values that are going to replace our belief that all individuals were created equal, with certain rights that come from their Creator? Are we prepared to retreat from the world stage and allow that to happen without at least speaking against it?&apos;, &quot;We should not be surprised that China stands by and says: Do nothing. Don&apos;t even sanction. Don&apos;t even put out a nasty letter about Syria. We should not be surprised because a nation that doesn&apos;t care about the human rights of their own people is never going to care about the human rights of others. As Americans, the question we have is, Are we prepared to retreat from the world stage and, in fact, allow nations such as that to play a growing role in the world? Are we prepared to silence our own voice at the expense of their voice? I hope not.&quot;, &quot;So when we debate in this Chamber about issues of economic policy, we are debating issues about America&apos;s influence in the world. And I would say to you that if America is diminished on the world stage, whether it be by choice or by accident, if we fail to confront the issues this nation faces and we choose to decline, it won&apos;t be just the Americans who pay the price, it will be people all over the world, including the people who live in Tibet, because then there will be no voice on this planet that condemns human rights violations the way we do, because there will be no nation in the world that can prove that, in fact, you can have a functional society where the innate worth and the value and rights that our Creator gives every human being are respected. That is what is at stake when we debate America&apos;s influence and America&apos;s standing in the world.&quot;, &apos;Over the next few weeks, I hope to come to this floor and continue to highlight these egregious violations of human rights. Tragically, there is no shortage of them. In the weeks to come, we will talk about the problems of human trafficking that exist in our own country, in our own hemisphere, and all around the world. We will talk about the violations of religious liberties that exist in societies all over the planet. We will talk about how women have no rights whatsoever in many of these countries. There are some nations where a woman is counted as one-fourth of a man in terms of their worth or their ability to speak out. We will talk about other countries where people are systematically jailed, as they are in our own hemisphere, for putting out pamphlets that criticize the government. We will talk about what is happening in Syria and Tibet.&apos;, &quot;Human rights is at the core of who we are as a nation. It is at the core of our identity as a people and as a power on the global stage. It is an issue that doesn&apos;t belong to the right or to the left, to Republicans or Democrats; it is an issue that should unite us all in this Chamber and in this country, and we hope to be an effective voice in that regard in the years that God permits me to serve here in the Senate.&quot;, &apos;I yield the floor.&apos;]

14. THE MYTH OF CHINA AS A HARMLESS TIGER on 2012-02-15: 
 [&quot;Mr. Speaker, I submit a piece authored by Chinese dissident Yu Jie which ran in yesterday&apos;s Washington Post. His words are deeply alarming about the extent of China&apos;s reach in the U.S. He rightly laments the lack of &#96;&#96;visionary politicians, such as Ronald Reagan, to stand up to this threat.&apos;&apos; I couldn&apos;t agree more.&quot;, &quot;Chinese dissident writers exiled to the West today get a very different response than Soviet writers received not so long ago. In 1975, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger advised President Ford not to meet with writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn, warning in a memorandum that doing so would offend the Soviet Union. Now, similar views are held not only by pragmatic politicians but also by multinational corporations with large investments in China as well as universities and foundations with inextricable links to China. The Chinese communist regime&apos;s penetration of the West far exceeds that of the former Soviet Union. In the Cold War era, the Soviet Union was blocked behind the Iron Curtain; there were few links between Soviet and Western economies. An average American family would not be using products &#96;&#96;made in the USSR.&apos;&apos; Today, China is deeply embedded within the globalized system. An American recently wrote an interesting book detailing a year of her refusal to buy products that were &#96;&#96;made in China&apos;&apos; and the many difficulties she encountered as a result of this decision. On the surface, the West has profited from its trade with China. Western consumers can buy vast amounts of cheap Chinese products. However, fundamental values of the West are quietly being eroded: Who knows whether the American flag flying outside your home was manufactured by inmates in Chinese prisons or by child labor? I arrived in the United States a month ago, thinking I had escaped the reach of Beijing, only to realize that the Chinese government&apos;s shadow continues to be omnipresent. Several U.S. universities that I have contacted dare not invite me for a lecture, as they cooperate with China on many projects. If you are a scholar of Chinese studies who has criticized the Communist Party, it would be impossible for you to be involved in research projects with the Chinese- funded Confucius Institute, and you may even be denied a Chinese visa. Conversely, if you praise the Communist Party, not only would you receive ample research funding but you might also be invited to visit China and even received by high-level officials. Western academic freedom has been distorted by invisible hands. I believe that China is a far greater threat than the former Soviet Union ever was; unfortunately, the West lacks visionary politicians, such as Ronald Reagan, to stand up to this threat. President Obama might perceive the Chinese Communist Party as a tiger that does not bite and, hence, is looking forward to Vice President Xi Jinping&apos;s visit this week. Will Obama, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, openly request that China release Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace laureate imprisoned by the Communist Party? Why did Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have the courage to meet with Burma&apos;s Aung San Suu Kyi but not to meet with Liu? Is it because Burma is weak, while China is strong? The Chinese Communist Party remains a tiger that will bite. For working on human rights with Liu Xiaobo, after he was awarded the Nobel Prize, I was tortured by the country&apos;s secret police and nearly lost my life. Since then, dozens of lawyers and writers have been subjected to brutal torture; some contracted severe pneumonia after being held in front of fans blowing cold air and then being baked by an electric furnace. The secret police threatened me, saying that they had a list of 200 anticommunist party intellectuals whom they were ready to arrest and bury alive. Over the past year, the number of political prisoners in China has increased, and the jail sentences have become longer--yet Western voices of protest have become weaker. Harsh internal repression and unrestrained external expansion are two sides of the same coin. The Chinese Communist Party recently vetoed the U.N. Security Council&apos;s resolution on Syria because killings not unlike those committed by Damascus continue in Tibet. More than a century ago, Westerners described China as a &#96;&#96;sleeping lion&apos;&apos;; today, it is the West that has fallen asleep. As an independent writer and a Christian member of a &#96;&#96;house church,&apos;&apos; I have the responsibility to tell the truth: The Chinese Communist Party is still a man-eating tiger.&quot;]

20. MOVING AHEAD FOR PROGRESS IN THE 21ST CENTURY ACT on 2012-02-29: 
 [&apos;I am so proud of this letter we wrote together. In the letter, we said:&apos;, &apos;The most important thing is to nominate an exceptionally well-qualified, intelligent person to replace Justice Souter. . . . Women make up more than half of our population, but right now hold only one seat out of nine. . . . This is out of balance. In order for the Court to be relevant, it needs to be diverse and better reflect America.&apos;, &apos;Then, of course, the President nominated Sonia Sotomayor and we were very excited about that.&apos;, &apos;So it was wonderful to work with her on that, and we worked together on respecting human rights in Tibet and led 27 Senators in a letter to Chinese leader Hu Jintao asking that Tibetans be respected. Regarding women in Afghanistan, we worked together to ask Afghan leaders to revise a law that would legalize marital rape and impose other Taliban restrictions on Shiite women in Afghanistan.&apos;, &apos;This is just a partial list of issues I have worked on with Olympia Snowe, and I will do a longer tribute for the record at a later time.&apos;, &apos;But, again, as I heard this news, I was first filled with worry about her health, and I hoped she was OK. But she has clarified she absolutely is. So I wish her nothing but the best. I know she will always work on issues because she is so good at looking at a problem and solving it and not thinking first whether it is Democratic or it is Republican or where it falls on the political scales. So I have appreciated working with her on so many of these important issues that have come before us.&apos;, &quot;I think the Senate should take a minute to think about this in relation to this bill. The whole world is watching us. When I say that, I don&apos;t mean the whole world literally, but I think the country is watching us. Why do I say that? Because 1,000 groups have endorsed our moving ahead with this bill--a coalition of 1,075 organizations from all 50 States. Here is what they said about this Transportation bill:&quot;, &apos;There are few Federal efforts that rival the potential of critical transportation infrastructure investments for sustaining and creating jobs and economic activity.&apos;, &quot;This is what they wrote. So they know this is the way to sustain and revive economic activity. This is what is at stake: Right now, 1.8 million jobs are created because we have a transportation bill. That bill ends March 31. So 1.8 million jobs are at stake if we don&apos;t act. Because of the way we wrote our bill, we leveraged funding, and this gained great bipartisan support. We have greatly increased the TIFIA Program, which is the transportation infrastructure financing program, which leverages funds by 30 times. Because of this, we believe we will see another 1 million jobs created. So we are talking 2.8 million jobs that are at stake. Yet we have an amendment on women&apos;s health. I just keep coming back to how insane that is.&quot;, &apos;I also wish to note again the many unemployed construction workers. Remember, I said 15 stadiums could be filled with unemployed construction workers. This is the number: 1.48 million construction industry workers unemployed. The unemployment rate is 17.7 percent among construction industry workers; whereas, the national unemployment rate is 8.3 percent. We know the housing sector is still having major problems getting out of the funk it is in. It is tough. So we have to do this bill.&apos;, &quot;I have a picture, just in case your mind&apos;s eye wasn&apos;t able to conjure it up. Here is a picture of a stadium filled with about 100,000 people. So 15 of these stadiums would basically reflect all the unemployed construction workers.&quot;, &quot;Which are the groups that are supporting us and are they bipartisan? Oh, my goodness. I don&apos;t think I could share with everyone a more bipartisan list of organizations than the AAA, the American Association of State Highway and Transit Officials, the American Bus Association, the American Concrete Pavement Association, the American Council of Engineering Companies, the American Highway Users Alliance, the American Moving &amp; Storage Association, the American Public Transportation Association, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, the American Society of Civil Engineers--and it goes on and on--the trucking association, the Metropolitan Transportation Organizations, Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, Governors Highway Safety Association, International Union of Operating Engineers, Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association, National Asphalt Pavement Association, National Association of Development Organizations, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Stone, Sand &amp; Gravel Association, National Construction Alliance.&quot;, &apos;Oh, it goes on. That is just a partial list of those 1,000-plus organizations.&apos;, &apos;When we started our bill the Presiding Officer will remember we made history because we had Richard Trumka, the head of the AFL CIO, sitting next to Tom Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Donohue and Trumka, the odd couple. They are fighting and arguing on everything. Yet they came together in front of our committee because they know we will all benefit. All of America benefits when we do a bill such as this.&apos;, &apos;I think I have shared a lot, but there is one more point. If we allow this bill to go away, and we are stuck with an extension because the transportation fund is not collecting enough gas tax revenues--and there is a good-news reason for that, which is we are getting better fuel economy and we are using public transit a lot more, so the gas tax is not coming in at the rate it normally does--we will be down 35 percent in the fund. So right away--right away--631,000 jobs are gone. But what is so great about our bill is that four committees, including the Finance Committee, filled the gap in a way that was bipartisan.&apos;, &quot;Our story is a great story to tell. If I had to tell my grandkids a story, I would say: Once upon a time in America, we didn&apos;t have a national road system. But a Republican President named Dwight Eisenhower had a vision. He was a general. He knew it was important to move things in a reliable way, and he had a vision of a national transportation system, and everybody in the country said: What a great idea. So we started to have a bill every few years to authorize a highway fund. Then somebody came up with the notion of it being funded by the users, so that the gas tax would go--part of it--to this fund and we would have enough in that fund to build our highways and our bridges, and then, later on, our transit systems. People said: We have a lot of wear and tear on the roads. What if a lot of people took public transit and got out of their cars? It would be better for the air quality. It would be better for everybody and for the state of the roads, and so they were married up, highways and transit and bridges.&quot;, &quot;Now we have to live up to that legacy and not bog this bill down with birth control amendments and women&apos;s health amendments and amendments about Egypt or anything else. There is time for that. We don&apos;t mind those battles but not on this bill. Infrastructure is the name of the game. We all know it--Republicans and Democrats.&quot;, &quot;So I say, let&apos;s stop playing games with this bill, please. Let&apos;s dispose of this birth control amendment, this women&apos;s health amendment. It doesn&apos;t belong on here. But if that is what it takes to get us off dead center, fine, let&apos;s go. To coin Olympia Snowe&apos;s phrase, it will be polarizing. It will not be pretty, but we will dispose of that and then we will move on and dispose of this bill.&quot;, &quot;I hope we will not have to face 5, 10, 20, 30 unrelated amendments. I hope we can get it down to a small number and move on. Let&apos;s pass this bill, lift the workers and lift our businesses. Every dollar, almost--most of the dollars--goes straight to the private sector through our States, through our local entities.&quot;, &quot;Then let&apos;s hold our head up high when we go home. So when I go to the supermarket I don&apos;t have people coming to me and saying: What is going on over there? Birth control on a highway bill. What, are you kidding? I don&apos;t want to have those conversations every time I go to the supermarket. What are these guys thinking, they say. I say: I don&apos;t know. I can&apos;t speak for them. I think it is an agenda that appeals to the far right of this Nation. It is not a mainstream way to go.&quot;, &apos;In closing now, for those who say Republicans and Democrats never work together, that is not true. Senator Inhofe and I are as far away from each other politically as two human beings can get, but we teamed up and put aside our ideologies, put aside our pet peeves, put aside things that, perhaps in our hearts, we truly wanted to do on this bill, and we met in the middle. He was over here and I was over here and we ended up right in the middle. We said: We can do this, and we proved we could do it. It was a challenge that was put to us by the leadership of both our parties and we met that test and other committees met that test.&apos;, &apos;So here we are. Are we now to say to committee chairs and ranking members, Republicans and Democrats alike, forget about it? It is not worth it. Work your heart out.&apos;, &quot;I pay tribute to my staff, my Democratic staff, and to Senator Inhofe&apos;s Republican staff. They worked night after night after night to come together on this bill. Then we were given an assignment 2 weeks ago to resolve the germane amendments and they have come together and they have resolved I don&apos;t know how many but dozens of amendments. So is the message, work your little hearts out, have your staff give up their nights with their families and come up with a bipartisan bill and all of a sudden have it subjected to some polarizing amendments that have nothing to do with the subject?&quot;, &quot;Please, let&apos;s not see this bill go down. Because if this bill goes down, let me tell you, I, for one, will go to as many cities as I can and counties in this country and tell the truth about what happened. There is no reason for us not to get this done, especially when we have the Chamber of Commerce working with the AFL CIO, we have Republican-leaning business organizations working with Democratic-leaning worker organizations all throughout this country--over 1,000 of them. I talk to them every week to say thank you to them for keeping the pressure on all of us to keep moving forward. When we have that kind of bipartisanship in our committees, when we have that type of bipartisan bill on the floor, when we have that type of bipartisan support in the country, it is time to move forward and get the job done for the American people.&quot;, &apos;I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.&apos;]

21. THREAT FROM HUAWEI on 2012-03-19: 
 [&apos;Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share troubling information that has come to my attention about Huawei, a Chinese telecom firm which is attempting to increase its market share in the U.S.&apos;, &quot;Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported that, &#96;&#96;Huawei&apos;s network business has thrived at the expense of struggling Western network companies,&apos;&apos; and is &#96;&#96;quietly building and investing in its own brand of high-end smart phones and tablets.&apos;&apos; But many Americans may not be aware that numerous government reports have linked Huawei&apos;s corporate leadership to the People&apos;s Liberation Army, raising serious concerns about its products being used for espionage by the Chinese Government.&quot;, &apos;Last week, respected national security reporter Bill Gertz wrote:&apos;, &quot;New information about Chinese civilian telecommunications companies&apos; close support of the Chinese military and information warfare programs is raising fresh concerns.&quot;, &quot;That is why both the Bush administration and the Obama administration have repeatedly intervened to block Huawei&apos;s growth. Huawei is controlled by the same government that jails Catholic bishops and Protestant pastors, oppresses the Uyghur Muslims, has plundered Tibet, and that is providing the very rockets that Sudanese President Bashir is using to kill his own people.&quot;, &quot;Mr. Speaker, the American people have a right to know whether their government is doing everything it can to protect their cell phone and data networks from foreign espionage and cyberattacks. As Huawei increases its lobbying presence in Washington, the American people should be fully aware of the firm&apos;s intimate links to the PLA and the serious concerns of our defense and intelligence community.&quot;, &quot;I rise today to share troubling information that has come to my attention about Huawei, a Chinese telecom firm, which is attempting to increase its market share in the United States and around the world. Numerous government reports have linked Huawei&apos;s corporate leadership to the Chinese intelligence services and the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA), raising concerns about Huawei networks and devices being subject to espionage by the Chinese government.&quot;, &quot;These connections are particularly noteworthy given Huawei&apos;s rapid rise as a telecom giant. According to an article in yesterday&apos;s Wall Street Journal, &#96;&#96;Huawei Technologies Co. has almost doubled its work force over the past five years as it strives to become a mobile technology heavyweight.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;The article also noted that, &#96;&#96;Huawei&apos;s network business has thrived at the expense of struggling Western network companies such as Alcatel-Lucent Co. and Nokia Siemens Networks. Initially, Huawei supplied low-cost phones to telecommunications operators in the West under their own brand, but over the past year, Huawei has also been quietly building and investing in its own brand of high-end smartphones and tablets.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;Huawei executives make no secret of their goal to dominate the telecom market. In a March 6, 2012, interview with the technology news Web site, Engadget, Huawei device chief Richard Yu said, &#96;&#96;In three years we want Huawei to be the industry&apos;s top brand.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;However, Huawei&apos;s growth in the U.S. market should give all Americans serious pause. Last week, respected national security reporter Bill Gertz wrote in the Washington Free Beacon that, &#96;&#96;New information about Chinese civilian telecommunications companies&apos; close support of the Chinese military and information warfare programs is raising fresh concerns about the companies&apos; access to U.S. markets,&apos;&apos; according to a report by the congressional US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. &#96;&#96;One of the companies identified in the report as linked to the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) is Huawei Technologies, a global network hardware manufacturer that has twice been blocked by the U.S. government since 2008 from trying to buy into U.S. telecommunications firms.&apos;&apos; &quot;, &quot;The congressional report noted that, &#96;&#96;Huawei is a well established supplier of specialized telecommunications equipment, training and related technology to the PLA that has, along with others such as Zhongxing, and Datang, received direct funding for R&amp;D on C4ISR [high-tech intelligence collection] systems capabilities.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;The report further added, &#96;&#96;All of these [Chinese telecom] firms originated as state research institutes and continue to receive preferential funding and support from the PLA,&apos;&apos; the report said.&quot;, &quot;Huawei&apos;s efforts to sell telecom equipment to U.S. networks have long troubled the U.S. defense and intelligence community, which has been concerned that Huawei&apos;s equipment could be easily compromised and used in Chinese cyberattacks against the U.S. or to intercept phone calls and e-mails from American telecom networks.&quot;, &quot;According to a 2005 report by the RAND Corporation, &#96;&#96;both the [Chinese] government and the military tout Huawei as a national champion,&apos;&apos; and &#96;&#96;one does not need to dig too deeply to discover that [many Chinese information technology and telecommunications firms] are the public face for, sprang from, or are significantly engaged in joint research with state research institutes under the Ministry of Information Industry, defense-industrial corporations, or the military.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;In fact, in 2009, the Washington Post reported that the National Security Agency &#96;&#96;called AT&amp;T because of fears that China&apos;s intelligence agencies could insert digital trapdoors into Huawei&apos;s technology that would serve as secret listening posts in the U.S. communications network.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;Over the last several years, Huawei&apos;s top executives&apos; deep connections to the People&apos;s Liberation Army and Chinese intelligence have been well documented. As Gertz summarized in his article, &#96;&#96;A U.S. intelligence report produced last fall stated that Huawei Technologies was linked to the Ministry of State Security, specifically through Huawei&apos;s chairwoman, Sun Yafang, who worked for the Ministry of State Security (MSS) Communications Department before joining the company.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;That is why senior administration officials in the Bush and Obama administrations have repeatedly intervened to block Huawei&apos;s access to U.S. networks. &#96;&#96;In 2008, the Treasury Department-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) blocked Huawei from purchasing the U.S. telecommunications firm 3Com due to the company&apos;s links to the Chinese military,&apos;&apos; Gertz reported. &#96;&#96;Last year, under pressure from the U.S. government, Huawei abandoned their efforts to purchase the U.S. server technology company 3Leaf. In 2010, Congress opposed Huawei&apos;s proposal to supply mobile telecommunications gear to Sprint over concerns that Sprint was a major supplier to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;It&apos;s not just Huawei&apos;s longstanding and tight connections to Chinese intelligence that should trouble us. Huawei has also been a leading supplier of critical telecom services to some of the worst regimes around the world. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Huawei &#96;&#96;now dominates Iran&apos;s government-controlled mobile-phone industry . . . it plays a role in enabling Iran&apos;s state security network.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;Gertz reported that Huawei has also been &#96;&#96;linked to sanctions-busting in Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq during the 1990s, when the company helped network Iraqi air defenses at a time when U.S. and allied jets were flying patrols to enforce a no-fly zone. The company also worked with the Taliban during its short reign in Afghanistan to install a phone system in Kabul.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;Mr. Speaker, given all of this information, there should be no doubt Huawei poses a serious national and economic security threat to the U.S. It is no secret that the People&apos;s Republic of China has developed the most aggressive espionage operation in modern history, especially given its focus on cyberattacks and cyberespionage.&quot;, &quot;Perhaps that is why Beijing has ensured that Huawei is able to continue its global market growth by &#96;&#96;unsustainably low prices and [Chinese] goverment export assistance,&apos;&apos; according to January 2011 congressional report on the national security implications of Chinese telecom companies. Due to China&apos;s secrecy, the full extent of Huawei&apos;s subsidies are not be fully known. But given its unrealistically low prices, it remains unknown whether Huawei is even making a profit as it seeks to dominate the telecom market. Why would the Chinese government be willing to generously subsidize such unprofitable products?&quot;, &quot;Earlier this year, The Economist magazine published a special report on Communist Party management of Chinese corporations. The Economist reported that, &#96;&#96;The [Communist] party has cells in most big companies--in the private as well as state-owned sector--complete with their own offices and files on employees. It holds meetings that shadow formal board meetings and often trump their decisions&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;The Chinese even have an expression for this strategy: &#96;&#96;The state advances while the private sector retreats.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;Author Richard McGregor wrote that the executives at Chinese companies have a &#96;&#96;red machine&apos;&apos; with an encrypted line to Beijing next to their Bloomberg terminals and personal items on their desks.&quot;, &quot;Last year, the Financial Times reported that the PLA has even documented how it will use telecom firms for foreign espionage and cyberattacks. A paper published in the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences&apos; journal noted: &#96;&#96;[These cyber militia] should preferably be set up in the telecom sector, in the electronics and internet industries and in institutions of scientific research,&apos;&apos; and its tasks should include &#96;&#96;stealing, changing and erasing data&apos;&apos; on enemy networks and their intrusion with the goal of &#96;&#96;deception, jamming, disruption, throttling and paralysis.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;The same article also documented the growing number PLA-led cyber militias housed in &#96;&#96;private&apos;&apos; Chinese telecom firms. The article reported on one example at the firm Nanhao: &#96;&#96;many of its 500 employees in Hengshui, just south-west of Beijing, have a second job. Since 2005 Nanhao has been home to a cybermilitia unit organized by the People&apos;s Liberation Army. The Nanhao operation is one of thousands set up by the Chinese military over the past decade in technology companies and universities around the country. These units form the backbone of the country&apos;s internet warfare forces, increasingly seen as a serious threat at a time of escalating global cybertensions.&quot;, &quot;Senior U.S. military and intelligence officials have become increasingly vocal about their concerns about the scope of Chinese espionage and cyberattacks. According to recent testimony given before the Senate, Defense Intelligence Agency chief General Ron Burgess said, &#96;&#96;China has used its intelligence services to gather information via a significant network of agents and contacts using a variety of methods . . . In recent years, multiple cases of economic espionage and theft of dual-use and military technology have uncovered pervasive Chinese collection efforts.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;Last year, the reticent Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive issued a warning that, &#96;&#96;Chinese actors are the world&apos;s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage.&apos;&apos; The counterintelligence office took this rare step of singling out the Chinese due to the severity of the threat to U.S. national and economic security.&quot;, &quot;And March 8, 2012 Washington Post article described how, &#96;&#96;For a decade or more, Chinese military officials have talked about conducting warfare in cyberspace, but in recent years they have progressed to testing attack capabilities during exercises . . . The [PLA] probably would target transportation and logistics networks before an actual conflict to try to delay or disrupt the United States&apos; ability to fight, according to the report prepared by Northrop Grumman for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;We are beginning to witness the consequences of this strategy. According to a March 13, 2012 New York Times article, &#96;&#96;During the five-month period between October and February, there were 86 reported attacks on computer systems in the United States that control critical infrastructure, factories and databases, according to the Department of Homeland Security, compared with 11 over the same period a year ago.&apos;&apos; &quot;, &quot;In an interview with the New York Times, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said, &#96;&#96;I think General Dempsey said it best when he said that prior to 9/11, there were all kinds of information out there that a catastrophic attack was looming. The information on a cyberattack is at the same frequency and intensity and is bubbling at the same level, and we should not wait for an attack in order to do something.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;A 2010 Pentagon report found &#96;&#96;. . . In the case of key national security technologies, controlled equipment, and other materials not readily obtainable through commercial means or academia, the People&apos;s Republic of China resorts to more focused efforts, including the use of its intelligence services and other-than legal means, in violation of U.S. laws and export controls.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;The report also highlighted China&apos;s cyber-espionage efforts. The U.S. intelligence community notes that China&apos;s attempts to penetrate U.S. agencies are the most aggressive of all foreign intelligence organizations.&quot;, &quot;Notably, Chinese espionage isn&apos;t limited to government agencies. In an October 4 Washington Post article, Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, remarked, &#96;&#96;When you talk to these companies behind closed doors, they describe attacks that originate in China, and have a level of sophistication and are clearly supported by a level of resources that can only be a nation-state entity.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;This prolific espionage is having a real and corrosive effect on job creation. Last year, the Washington Post reported that, &#96;&#96;The head of the military&apos;s U.S. Cyber Command, Gen. Keith Alexander, said that one U.S. company recently lost $1 billion worth of intellectual property over the course of a couple of days--&#96;technology that they&apos;d worked on for 20-plus years--stolen by one of the adversaries.&apos; &apos;&apos;&quot;, &quot;That is why, in February 2012 testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence FBI Director Robert Mueller said that while terrorism is the greatest threat today, &#96;&#96;down the road, the cyber threat will be the number one threat to the country.&apos;&apos;&quot;, &apos;Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that Huawei is one face of this emerging threat. And the American people have a right to know whether their government is doing everything it can to protect their cell phone and data networks.&apos;, &quot;As Huawei increases its lobbying presence in Washington, members should be fully aware of the firm&apos;s intimate links to the PLA and the serious concerns of our defense and intelligence community.&quot;, &apos;Verizon, Sprint, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and other U.S. network carriers should not be selling Huawei devices given these security concerns. But if they do, they have an obligation to inform their customers of these threats. This is especially important when carriers are selling Huawei phones and tablets to corporate customers.&apos;, &apos;They have a right to know that Beijing may be listening.&apos;]

23. HUMAN RIGHTS DAY on 2012-12-10: 
 [&apos;Mr. President, I come here on December 10, Human Rights Day. I want to briefly discuss human rights because, I would just say, while we have made great advances around the world in the cause of human rights, there are still a lot of roads to travel. Today is a good opportunity to take note of some of the struggles and challenges around the world with regard to human rights.&apos;, &apos;The first issue I want to talk about with regard to human rights is modern-day slavery. When people think about slavery they think about the historic nature of slavery in this country or around the world. It is hard to imagine that today, in the 21st century, that there are slaves in the world. It is even harder to believe there are slaves in the United States, but the fact is there are. It has been well documented that human trafficking around the world numbers in the millions.&apos;, &apos;Of course, sex trafficking is a big part of that, a grotesque part of that, and we are all aware that it is a very serious problem. So too is forced labor-type slavery, which we find around the world and even in the United States. In fact, there is no major city in the United States that does not have an element of human trafficking and human slavery within its confines. I think it is important to understand that exists, it is real, and it is happening.&apos;, &apos;To that extent, remember there are things we are trying to do in this legislative body, in the Senate, in Washington, to deal with this issue. One of the issues we are going to have a chance to deal with soon, I hope, is reauthorizing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which was sponsored last year by Senator Brown and Senator Leahy. Hopefully, we can finish that before the end of this year, but if we cannot, I hope early in the next Congress we will address it.&apos;, &apos;As you know, there are also reports that the State Department does rank countries around the world on the efforts they are making to deal with human trafficking, and they actually rank them in three tiers, the third being the worst, those nations not doing enough. I hope we look at how we reform the process of giving some of these countries waivers. There are countries that are perpetually on the list of the worst possible places with regard to government policy toward human trafficking. Yet they are getting waivers from the implications and the consequences of being a tier 3 country. There are countries getting that waiver every single year. &apos;, &apos;I hope we will examine the process legislatively, of how we grant those waivers, so we can have more information as to exactly why it is our government is granting waivers to other governments and other nations that are not making any advances whatsoever on human slavery and trafficking.&apos;, &apos;Another aspect we should take some time to look at is some transparency from the business community, particularly large international companies that do business around the world. We should look for ways to encourage and incentivize companies to report voluntarily on their supply chains to ensure the products we use in the United States are not the product of human slavery, modern slavery around the world. We can do that as well.&apos;, &apos;Obviously, we do not want to put any more onerous costs on our businesses, and we will be careful how we approach it, but I think it is important that we know the products sold in the United States are not directly or indirectly benefiting from slavery around the world. That is something I hope we will remember; that human trafficking and human slavery is real, it exists all around the world, and exists in our own country. I hope we will continue making strides dealing with this issue.&apos;, &apos;One last point on that is a few months ago several of my colleagues and I sent a letter to the Village Voice, which is a newspaper in the United States, which actively--and unfortunately--advertises in its back pages, including in a site called backpage.com. It advertises the services of people being held against their will in those circumstances. It is outrageous to believe a major American publication continues to advertise the services of young girls and young boys, some of whom are minors, and is doing so shamelessly. I hope they will heed our call to stop that from happening. It is a massive source of revenue for that company. It is outrageous, it is disgusting, it is grotesque, and I hope more of our colleagues will join us in writing a new letter to them in continuing to call attention to this because it is simply unacceptable.&apos;, &apos;Secondly, I want to turn to the issue of religious freedom, which is another human rights cause around the world. Sadly there is not enough advancement being made in that regard. We are seeing a step backward with regard to religious liberty and religious freedom around the world.&apos;, &apos;In April of this year the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom released its latest report with some very grim news. I want to go through some of it, but it is important to understand we are not talking about the countries, we are talking about the governments. There are some governments that are aiding and abetting the persecution of unprotected religious minorities. I want to highlight some of those countries and governments. The list is long, but these are a few I wanted to point to today that are truly unacceptable.&apos;, &quot;Let&apos;s start with the People&apos;s Republic of China, which is not exactly a beacon of hope for those who are looking for religious liberty. Of course we all know the situation in Tibet, which is not just a religious issue, it is a cultural issue. We see the self-immolation of folks who are willing to burn alive because of the effort of that government to wipe out their identity. What they are going through is intolerable.&quot;, &quot;It goes much deeper than that. Proselytizing Christians and the orthodox, &#96;&#96;nonpatriotic&apos;&apos; Catholic Church, face significant oppression. The Chinese Government actually authorizes who the leadership of the Catholic Church can be. It is truly unique that in all the world there is a government that will tell them who their bishops are and who will run their church. If they worship outside of that setting, they are persecuted.&quot;, &apos;There are others, of course, such as the Tibetan Buddhists whom I mentioned before. Here is a report that talks about that. It is not just the religious believers who are facing persecution in China. This is from the report:&apos;, &apos;The Chinese government also continues to harass, detain, intimidate, disbar, and forcibly disappear attorneys who defend vulnerable religious groups.&apos;, &apos;Again, we need to understand that we are not talking about the people of China; we are talking about the government of China which is aiding, abetting, and allowing this religious persecution to go on. We hope with the change in leadership in China that has taken place there will be a change in attitude.&apos;, &apos;The truth is that China has much to offer the world. We hope for a peaceful, prosperous rise for the people of China. We look forward to working together with them to make the world a better place. But China cannot assume that role as long as there is no respect for religious liberties as far as these practices that are happening in that country with the direction of its government.&apos;, &apos;Of course Egypt has been in the headlines lately. I think it has been well documented that violence particularly against orthodox Christians has been high. This is from the report:&apos;, &apos;In 2011, violent sectarian attacks, targeting primarily Coptic Orthodox Christians, have resulted in nearly 100 deaths, surpassing the death toll of the previous 10 years combined.&apos;, &apos;I think the Arab spring has a lot of promise, but I think it also brings with it some warning flags. One of those warning flags is the persecution of religious minorities in places such as Egypt. So as Egypt works its way forward--and we know it has problems it is facing in its own society with regard to what kind of government and powers it needs and should have--we should keep an eye on how the new constitution, the new laws, and the new government treat religious minorities, particularly Coptic Orthodox Christians who suffered the death of 100 of their members.&apos;, &apos;Iran does not have a sterling record on human rights. Its treatment of religious minorities is particularly egregious. The violations of religious freedoms in Iran include prolonged detention, torture, and executions based primarily or entirely upon the religion of the accused. All religious minorities in Iran are at risk, but even the recognized non-Muslim religious minorities that are supposedly protected under their so-called Constitution, including Jews, Armenian, and Assyrian Christians, face increasing discrimination, arrests, and imprisonment, according to the report. So too are dissenting Muslims. They are basically Muslims who are not following the Shia line. They are being intimidated, harassed, and detained. That is the record of Iran, which has a terrible human rights record, but in particular with the issues of religious liberty.&apos;, &apos;Saudi Arabia bans any non-Muslim worship. Even private religious activities are suppressed if they are discovered. I think it is important to point that out as well.&apos;, &apos;Closer to home is the island of Cuba, which is a place, of course, because of my heritage which is close and near to our heart so we keep a close eye on what is happening there as well.&apos;, &apos;The report finds:&apos;, &apos;Serious religious freedom violations continue in Cuba . . . Violations by the Cuban government include: detention, sporadic arrests, and harassment of clergy and religious leaders, as well as interference in church affairs. The Cuban government also controls and monitors religious belief and practices through surveillance and legal restrictions.&apos;, &apos;In Russia the report finds:&apos;, &quot;The government increasingly used its anti-extremist law against peaceful religious groups and individuals, particularly Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses and Muslim readers of the works of Turkish theologian Said Nursi.&quot;, &apos;Russia is a country that is beginning to backslide on religious liberty as well.&apos;, &apos;Finally, here in this hemisphere, just as in Cuba, Venezuela. The report finds that violations of religious liberty include:&apos;, &quot;The government&apos;s failure to investigate and hold accountable perpetrators of attacks on religious leaders and houses of worship, and virulent rhetoric president Hugo Chavez, government officials, state media, and pro- Chavez media directed at the Venezuelan Jewish and Christian communities.&quot;, &apos;I think sometimes we take for granted the religious liberties we have in this country, and we should never do so. The fact is we may have some cultural divisions in America when it comes to religion, and that is not tolerable either. But one of the great things we have had in this country since its inception is the belief in religious liberty and religious freedom enshrined in our governing Constitution. It is something that is the exception rather than the rule around the world. I think our example should inspire the world in that regard, but I think we should always use our voice, our power, and our example to lead the way around the world on this Human Rights Day on the issue of religious liberty.&apos;, &apos;Last but not least, the cause for women around the world is something that bears watching as well. Some of these issues are interrelated. When I talk about human trafficking and human slavery, a disproportionate number of those held in bondage around the world are young women and young girls.&apos;, &quot;On the issue of human rights with regard to women, there are a couple of parts of the world that are very troubling. Afghanistan comes to mind because just today we got the report that a senior advocate for women in Afghanistan was shot down by unknown gunmen on Monday. It is the latest assassination against women&apos;s rights activists in the country. Najia Seddiqi was headed to her office in the eastern Laghman province when she was shot and killed. She was the head of the Women&apos;s Affairs Department for the Laghman province. Her predecessor in that post was killed just 4 months ago. The Taliban, which many hold responsible for the attack, has not yet had a comment, but it comes just a week after a teenage girl who was volunteering at an anti-polio drive was fatally shot northeast of Kabul. The Taliban has targeted senior female officials in the past for working in the U.S.-backed Afghan Government. That is just one issue of a coordinated attack to go after women who dare to participate in the political life of the country. It goes beyond that.&quot;, &apos;There is this very troubling law in Afghanistan which the government claims to have tried to clear up. It is called running away. Basically some judges have interpreted running away as a crime. It has been used against young girls and women who run away from home because it is a home where they are being abused or a home where they are being forced to marry somebody.&apos;, &apos;There are some sad stories I want to share. A 17-year-old leapt from her roof to the streets of Kabul in an effort to avoid marriage ordained by her grandfather when she was only 9 years old. The judge who heard the case mentioned that Farima ruined her life. The judge stated in a court that the court is a place where a woman can plead for divorce or custody of her children only if and when she has five male witnesses and a husband or a fiance who condones the separation.&apos;, &apos;This is the 21st century we are talking about. We are not reading something from history. This is happening right now. Of course we all know the story of the brave little girl in Pakistan who was shot. We hear these cases every single day. It goes on and on. I could be here for 3 hours highlighting abuses against women, against religious liberty, the abuses of human trafficking and human slavery around the world. I think what is important today on December 10, Human Rights Day, is to take a moment and understand that the cause of human rights is not a partisan cause; it is not even a nationalist cause. It is a human cause that requires each and every one of us to raise our voice and to call attention to any time and any place where human rights are violated.&apos;, &apos;I want to congratulate the leading role this government has played in calling attention to those abuses around the world and in being honest with ourselves when these things are happening here at home. Of course, like anything else, we have to first set the example before we can lead, and that is why I think it is so important that on the issue of human trafficking and modern-day slavery that the United States have cutting-edge legislation which deals with an emerging problem that keeps changing and so the laws have to adapt to it. I hope we will take the first step in doing that by authorizing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act as soon as possible.&apos;, &apos;I suggest the absence a quorum.&apos;]
